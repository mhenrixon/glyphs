  # Deletes synced SVG icons that no source references, keeping the union of:
  # scanned references, the configured keep_icons allowlist (names or globs,
  # flat or per-library), and the configured fallback_icons (always — a pruned
  # fallback would make every future missing-icon 500).
  #
  # Operates only on `icons_root` (`app/assets/svg/icons`), skips the bundled
  # `animated` library, never deletes non-.svg files, and refuses to empty a
  # library whose computed keep-set is empty (guards against a mis-scan wiping a
  # whole library). Returns a PruneReport.
