module Glyphs
  # A single (library, variant, name) icon reference discovered in source, with
  # the shared library/variant resolution tables the scanner and the RuboCop
  # cops both rely on.
  #
  # `library` is an icons-gem library symbol (`:lucide`), `variant` is a string
  # or nil (variant-less libraries), and `name` is dasherized (`"circle-check"`).
  #
  # The library/variant tables are sourced from the `icons` gem wherever
  # possible (`default_variant_for`) so they never drift from what actually
  # resolves at render time.
  class IconReference < Data.define(:library, :variant, :name) # rubocop:disable Style/DataInheritance
    # Subclassed (not the block form) so the constants below are namespaced under
    # IconReference — constants defined inside a `Data.define do…end` block leak
    # to the enclosing scope instead of nesting under the class.
    #
    # Maps every Glyphs library component to its icons-gem library symbol. This
    # is the canonical map; `RuboCop::Cop::Glyphs::LibraryCallHelpers` reads it
    # so the cops and the pruner agree on the full set of libraries.
